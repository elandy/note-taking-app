# SmartNotes Plus
SmartNotes Plus is an enhanced version of the SmartNotes project from the LinkedIn Learning course "Django Essential Training." This project builds on the foundation of the original SmartNotes project and includes additional features to enhance the user experience.

## Features
- User Profile: Users can now create a profile and upload a profile picture.
- Sortable Notes: Implemented using jQuery Sortable, allowing users to easily reorder their notes.

## Usage
Once the server is running, users can sign up, create notes, upload a profile picture, and reorder notes using the drag-and-drop feature.
